# Future-location-prediction
To predict a user's next location based on their behavioral location-based data, as well as their various types of connections with geolocation, you would need to use a combination of machine learning algorithms and geospatial analysis techniques.Applying Markov Model to get the transition matrix from their historical data. Using this transition matrix we predict the next location with probabilistic value. Also, the userâ€™s linked with some location based on the association, event, organization, and individual. Using the clustering mechanism (DBSCAN) we are predicting the accumulating probability of the specific location.
